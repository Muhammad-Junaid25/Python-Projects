# Predicting the Severity of Traffic Accidents in Northampton shire through Data Analysis & Visualization

In this project, an analysis of accident severities in Northamptonshire, UK in 2015 was conducted, with a specific focus on speed limits. Statistical techniques were employed to visualize and identify trends in the data. Correlation heatmaps were created to gain insights into the relationships between variables. Additionally, machine learning techniques such as MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and random forest, along with deep learning algorithms like ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), were applied to predict accident severity.



路	Conducted an analysis of accident severities in Northampton shire, UK in 2015, focusing on speed limits.
路	 Applied matplotlib and seaborn libraries to generate multiple visualizations, encompassing histograms, count plots, bar plots, and heatmaps. These visualizations delve into various facets of the dataset, encompassing accident severity distribution, accident counts per speed limit, accident severity in relation to speed limit and road type, accident counts in urban or rural areas, and variable correlations.
路	Utilized statistical techniques such as one-way ANOVA and ANOVA test to visualize and identify trends in the data and created correlation heatmaps to understand variable relationships.
路	Applied machine learning techniques (MLP and Random Forest) and Deep learning algorithms (ANN and CNN) for predicting accident severity.
