# Predicting the Severity of Traffic Accidents in Northampton shire through Data Analysis & Visualization

In this project, an analysis of accident severities in Northamptonshire, UK in 2015 was conducted, with a specific focus on speed limits. Statistical techniques were employed to visualize and identify trends in the data. Correlation heatmaps were created to gain insights into the relationships between variables. Additionally, machine learning techniques such as MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and random forest, along with deep learning algorithms like ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), were applied to predict accident severity.
